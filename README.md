Data from: 40 years of evolution. Darwin's finches on Daphne Major Island.

Peter and Rosemary Grant of Princeton University have visited the island of Daphne Major on the Gal√°pagos every year for over forty years and have been taking a careful inventory of the finches there. The Grants recently published a wonderful book, 40 years of evolution: Darwin's finches on Daphne Major Island. They were generous and made their data publicly available on the Dryad data repository.
